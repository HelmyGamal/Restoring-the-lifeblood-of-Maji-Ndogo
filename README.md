# Restoring-the-lifeblood-of-Maji-Ndogo
At the heart of this project is the water crisis faced by a fictitious country called Maji Ndogo. This project progressively challenges us and offers less guidance as we progress, pushing us to think critically. By the end, we wonâ€™t just have a deeper understanding of SQL but also a blueprint for how to approach problems in future missions.
