# Restoring-the-lifeblood-of-Maji-Ndogo
This project's heart is the water crisis faced by a fictitious country called Maji Ndogo. In this project, we will dive deep into the intricacies of
using SQL to solve complex problems.
This project progressively challenges us and pushes us to think critically. By the end, we will have
a deeper understanding of SQL and a blueprint for approaching problems in future missions.
